Here’s a quick recap of what we accomplished:

Your GJSIST school website was redesigned for a modern, professional, and consistent look using Bootstrap 5, with a unified navbar, hero, and footer.
All main content pages were updated to match the UDS university style, with dropdown navigation and responsive sections.
The “Opening Soon” section was formatted for best image fit and clarity.
A summary presentation webpage (presentation.html) was created to showcase the website’s features and usage.
A PowerPoint presentation (with and without image placeholders) was generated for you to present to others.
Instructions were provided for adding screenshots and exporting to PDF.
